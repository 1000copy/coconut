=======

A simple markdown based blog engine.

The configuration file is conf.yaml. It *must* exist because there are no builtin defaults.

Articles are in Markdown and should be placed in `articles` with the file extension ".md". The theme file is in `articles/theme.html`. Any static files like CSS and images should be placed in `static`.
The front, login, and publish pages are in there as well.

TODO
----

 -  Move the theme.html file to `static`
 -  Add a system for arbitrary pages
 -  Add a way to list blog articles on the front page
 -  Add metadata to articles
