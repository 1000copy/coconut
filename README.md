coconut
=======

A simple markdown based blog engine.

The configuration file is conf.yaml. It *must* exist because there are no builtin defaults.

Articles are in Markdown and should be placed in `articles` with the file extension ".md". The theme files are in `static/theme`. Any static files like CSS and images should be placed in `static`. The login and publish pages are in there as well. Pages are in Markdown, with urls and file paths specified in conf.yaml. Note that all page file paths are relative to `static`.
